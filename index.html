<h1>What does the future look like?</h1>
<p>Predicting semantic segmentation frames of traffic environments.</br>
  The data is obtained using the <a href="http://carla.org">CARLA</a> simulator at 5 fps.<p>

<h2>Samples</h2>
<p>Conditioned on 10 initial frames. Image dimensions are 3x64x64<p>

  <h2>Evaluation</h2>
  <p>Mean IoU from a selection of classes. The measurements are from 192 sequences with a confidence</br>
    interval of 95%. Some critical classes, like vehicles and pedestrians, are barely represented.</br>
    This might be due to the fact that they are small by size and seldom occur in the training set.</br>
    The mean IoU is still strong since there are a few dominating classes which are predicted very well.<p>
  <IMG SRC="img/iou_data.png">
    <p>The thought behind this plot/metric is to investigate how far into the future it is convenient
      (useful) to predict what will happen. As expected, the mean IoU decreases over time.
  <h2> What next?</h2>
  <p> Could it be an idea to evaluate main events of the predictions, rather than comparing individual frames?</br>
    If so - how?</br></br>
    Ideas # Classify events:</br>
    right turn | left turn | intersection | pedestrian crossing
